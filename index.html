    <h1>The Best Movies According to Vaibhav</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time in each industry .</h2>
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid grey;">
<h2>Hollywood</h2>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Interstellar</h2></li>
    <p>
        One of the reasons Interstellar is my favourite because of its scientific accuracy. The idea of time dilation due to gravity on the behemoth planet, wormholes, and even the black hole shown was ahead of its time.
    </p>
    <li><h3>Inception</h2></li>
    <p>
        Inception is a mind-bending masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences more than a decade after its release. The film's complex story, stunning visual effects, and innovative approach to filmmaking have helped make it a modern classic.
    </p>
    <li><h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h2></li>
    <p>
        The main themes of The Wolf of Wall Street are greed, addiction, and corruption that results from overindulgence in materialism. It shows how Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his associates engage in unethical financial practices that harm other people to satisfy their own desires for money, power, and status.
    </p>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Bollywood</h2>
<ul>
    <li><h3>3 Idiots</h2></li>
    <p>
        The movie is able to strike a perfect balance between comedy and drama, and this is one of the reasons it has become such a beloved classic in Bollywood.
    </p>
    <li><h3>Ghajini</h2></li>
    <p>
        An exuberantly excessive and unreasonably entertaining mash-up of musical-comedy romance, action-movie mayhem and psycho-thriller suspense.
    </p>
    <li><h3>Lagaan</h2></li>
    <p>
        Lagaan's brilliance was in its plot's simplicity, along with the theme of the common man's fight for justice and against an unjust ruler. The film displays the best ways to lead a team, or for that matter even build one.
    </p>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Telgu Cinema</h2>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Baahubali</h2></li>
    <p>
        Everything about this film is good - Story, direction, beautiful cinematography, haunting score and amazing visuals.
    </p>
    <li><h3>RRR</h2></li>
    <p>
        This big epic action movie reminds me of some of those Fast and Furious movies because of the really outlandish action sequences, but this film has the added attraction of Bollywood style musical numbers and a showy dance off.
    </p>
    <li><h3>KGF</h2></li>
    <p>
        It's a film that's high on style, heavy on action, and is carried by the powerhouse presence of its charismatic star, Yash
    </p>
